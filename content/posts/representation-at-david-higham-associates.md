title: Representation at David Higham Associates

I﻿'m so thrilled to have recently signed a contract with Sara Langham, an agent at David Higham Associates. It has come somewhat out of the blue, so I think it's still sinking in!

I﻿ have mostly been writing scripts over the last few years, but I did write one short story, 'Blighty One'. It did ok in the big international competitions (﻿made the top few % in Bridport, Fish and Commonwealth), but didn't win anything until I entered it in ChipLit. The judge was literary agent Jo Unwin and part of my prize was to have lunch with her. Jo was on the cusp of retiring from being a literary agent, but she was determined to help me and she very kindly wrote emails of introduction to some other agents, attaching Blighty One and a few other examples of my short stories. And this is how I've ended up with Sara as my agent.

I﻿ couldn't be more delighted. For some reason, when I started writing seriously 15 years ago, I decided David Higham was the agency I really wanted to be signed by. I tried a lot of agencies, of course, but they were the top one for me. I still have my rejection email from the kids novel wrote back then when I had no idea what I was doing! So for a DHA agent to approach me and ask to represent me, is very special. Sara is fabulous. We are interested in the same sort of stories and styles and I know she'll help me so much with the editing of these early drafts. Absolute dream.

S﻿o, while I certainly don't intend to give up scriptwriting entirely, I am now concentrating on writing the first draft of a new novel. It has been a few years since I wrote a book and I'm enjoying it so much. I feel as if I have done a 15-year apprenticeship and I am finally finding out who I am as a writer. Watch this space...
