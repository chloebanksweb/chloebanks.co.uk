In 2022 I read 39 books - mostly novels, but some non-fiction and collections as well - and I listened to 24 audiobooks. So which were my favourite?

At the end of the year, I have seven books that I gave 10/10 for how much I enjoyed them. This isn't a comment on how "good" they are - just how much I loved reading/listening to them. Here they are...

* _My Cousin Rachel_ - Daphne du Maurier
* _Euphoria_ - Lily King
* _Six Against the Yard_ - collection of classic crime authors
* _Lessons in Chemistry_ - Bonnie Garmus
* _Bewilderment_ - Richard Powers
* _The Woman in White_ - Wilkie Collins
* _The Foundling_ - Stacey Halls

Here is where I would usually pick a very favourite, but I can't! Perhaps _Euphoria_, or _Bewilderment_... but I'm not sure.

There were another 11 books that I gave 9/10. So of these 18 books, two were short story collections. All the rest were novels. No non-fiction in my best lists this year. Anyone got any good non-fiction to get me going in 2023?

One of my top-18 books this year was by a collection of authors, three were by men, and the other 14 by women. The publication dates ranged from 2022, back to 1859. Only one of them (_Bewilderment_) was a 21st-century-published book, set in the 21st-centry, which surprises me!

Here are the rest of my list:

* _The Hours Before Dawn_ - Celia Framlin
* _The Vanishing Half_ - Brit Bennett
* _The Appeal_ - Janice Hallett
* _Fingersmith_ - Sarah Waters
* _Stories of Your Life & Others_ - Ted Chiang
* _The Essex Serpent_ - Sarah Perry
* _The Christie Affair_ - Nina de Gramont
* _The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets_ - Eva Rice
* _Confession_ - Jessie Burton
* _Absent in the Spring_ - Mary Westmacott
* _New Boy_ - Tracey Chevalier
