My short play, 'Henry VIII and Jane II' is going to be performed at INK Festival in Sussex next month. I'm excited! INK is the UK's largest producing theatre of short plays and their festivals are legendary. They put on about 70 short plays during their four-day festival - chosen out of over 900 submissions. So it's a great honour to be selected. If you are at all able to get to Halesworth between 11th-14th  April please do go along (I believe my play will be on every day at some point).\

I﻿ have a special affection for this short play. Mostly because it's very silly. It's set on the number 12 bus to Torquay and involves Henry VIII returning from a period of personal growth to try to chat up a seventh wife. I'm not sure when else in my life I'm going to write a play that uses words like forsooth and wench, alongside talking about kimchi and crossfit...
