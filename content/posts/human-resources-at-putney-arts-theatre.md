It was an absolute delight this weekend to go to London to see my play, HUMAN RESOURCES, live on stage at [Putney Arts Theatre](https://www.putneyartstheatre.org.uk/).

PAT ran a competition for new one-act stage plays and I was so thrilled to be selected. As I only started writing scripts after the start of the pandemic (I know... great timing, right?), this was my first opportunity to see something of mine performed live. Really special that it was a full one-act as well.

My play was directed by Craig Legg and I just loved the whole process of working with him and Rebecca Marangos (Head of New Writing), and then seeing what the end result was. And the end result was fantastic! Being able to sit in the audience anonymously and listen to them gasp and laugh and fall silent in all the right places was a great experience (as was catching snatches of conversation in the bar afterwards about how much people had enjoyed it!)

Everyone was so very kind and encouraging about my script. It has definitely given me a taste for more of the same! And, as it happens...

My next live-performed play is a ten-minute short, DESK MONSTER - part of KDC Theatre's festival, [YOU, ME AND NOOR](https://www.kdctheatre.com/you-me-and-noor/), at the end of June.
