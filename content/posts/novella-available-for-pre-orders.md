My novella, _At the Bottom of the Stairs_, is now available for ordering from Reflex Press. Publication date is 10th May, but you can beat the rush by pre-ordering a paperback by clicking [HERE](https://www.reflex.press/product/at-the-bottom-of-the-stairs/). (An e-book version will be available after publication).

As we approach publication day, I am in the No-Man's Land of being both terrified that people are actually going to read it, and terrified that nobody is going to read it. I have had a few lovely endorsements from some amazing writers and editor though, which is helping the nerves. Here are some of the things they've said...

"_...a sweeping and poignant story that delves into the intricacies of motherhood, relationships, longing, and regret, all set against the backdrop of the technological and familial changes of the 20th century. I was completely drawn in by the entwining lives of the central characters, so beautifully sketched by Banks. At the Bottom of the Stairs is a genuinely touching book and a pleasure to read._" Gaynor Jones

"_Full of wisdom, beauty and skill, Banks creates a powerful story that pierces the soul and lingers long after reading. She has painted a masterpiece iridescent with hope, dreams and steadfast love._" FJ Morris

"_It's a profound character study - its two main figures captured on the page with compassionate insight and skill. And it's a love-letter to language - such is the quality of her prose. Banks writes about the psychology of motherhood and womanhood with as much nuance as any writer I've encountered._" Michael Loveday

So if you like tales of love and loss and gain and tree-climbing and female space explorers, do please take a look! You can even [read the first chapter for free](https://www.reflex.press/stories/everything-after-now-by-chloe-banks/) on the publisher's website.
