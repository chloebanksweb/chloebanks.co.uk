I've had some lovely reviews for it already from other writers and readers... Among other things it has been described as: full of wisdom, beauty and skill; a powerful story that pierces the soul; sweeping and poignant; iridescent with hope; and a many-sided jewel. Which is all very generous and lovely!

If that hasn't persuaded you, however, you can read the first chapter for free [here ](https://www.reflex.press/product/at-the-bottom-of-the-stairs/)first!

So if you like jumping out of trees, dogs in rockets, the grief and joy of parenthood, and women doing backflips in space, please do [check it out](https://www.reflex.press/product/at-the-bottom-of-the-stairs/)!
