The first half of 2023 has been a good one for my writing. I’m so delighted to have had my play *Human Resources* selected by no less than the Royal Shakespeare Company to be part of their new folio of 37 plays – celebrating 400 years since Shakespeare’s first folio, by telling the stories of our time. There were over 2000 entries and it came as a huge shock to make the shortlist – let alone be included in the final folio.


My play will be showcased at Hall for Cornwall in Truro this autumn and I’m hoping will go on to have a full professional production somewhere. If you are a producer looking for a slightly dystopian story about what happens when healthcare is based on the value society places on you as an individual… let me know!


I have been writing a lot and entering a lot of things. A short film script of mine, *Drystone*, has won the Action on the Side script award, and is currently a finalist – having won its block – in the White Rose International Film Festival. I am awaiting feedback and results from many other things. The life of a writer! Keep writing, keep submitting, keep hoping. 


I am so pleased to have been selected by London Playwrights for their writer development scheme. This will be 10 months of workshops and development opportunities, starting this September. I am especially happy that I was selected off the strength of my play script *Here’s What I Found*, which has had such lovely feedback from a few theatres, but not yet found a home. I love this play and am determined to develop it to a standard where somebody wants it!


Currently, I am working on several projects: a couple of full-length stage plays (one semi-sensible, one extremely silly); a short (and also very silly) play; developing *Drystone* for future opportunities. Trying to keep my options open and be ready for the opportunities when they come. This writing life is not for the faint-hearted!
