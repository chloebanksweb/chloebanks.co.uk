I﻿n 2023 I have read 34 books and listened to 30 audiobooks - as well as reading many play scripts and listening to countless podcast episodes!

I﻿ give all books a mark out of ten. This is purely an enjoyment mark! Although the quality of the writing does have a big effect on how much I enjoy it, I never try to mark a book on how "good" it is. Who am I to say?!

T﻿his is a list of all the books I gave a full 10/10 to in 2023...

* *M﻿rs England* - Stacey Halls
* *A﻿ Little Life* - Hanya Yanagihara
* *I﻿ Capture the Castle* - Dodie Smith
* *A﻿n Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth* - Chris Hadfield \[audiobook]
* *I﻿ Have Some Questions For You* - Rebecca Makkai \[audiobook]
* *D﻿emon Copperhead* - Barbara Kingsolver
* *N﻿otes on an Execution* - Danya Kukafka
* *T﻿he Other Side of Mrs Wood* - Lucy Barker
* *T﻿he Marriage Portrait* - Maggie O'Farrell
* *T﻿omorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow* - Gabrielle Zevin

1﻿0 books - nine novels and a sort of memoir (which would be my surprise pick of the year!) I couldn't pick a favourite, but I think it would be between *I Capture the Castle, Demon Copperhead, The Marriage Portrait* and *Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow*. I'm not sure there's much touching Barbara Kingsolver and Maggie O'Farrell for sheer brilliance. (I have also already gifted *The Other Side of Mrs Wood* to a couple of people because it was so much fun to read.)

S﻿pecial mention to all my 9/10 books:
﻿*Ladder of Years* - Anne Tyler, *Giving Up the Ghost* - Hilary Mantel, *Leonard and Hungry Paul* - Ronan Hession, *A Damsel in Distress* - P G Wodehouse, *A Terrible Kindness* - Jo Browning Wroe, *Dancer's in Mourning* - Margery Allingham, *Bad Summer People* - Emma Rosenblum, *Lord Emsworth Does His Best* - P G Wodehouse, *The Marriage Act* - John Mars, *Yellowface* - R F Kuang, *The Fraud* - Zadie Smith, *A Town Called Solace* - Mary Lawson, *Free Love* - Tessa Hadley.

W﻿hich means 23 of my 64 books this year are five-star reads for me. Pretty good going!
