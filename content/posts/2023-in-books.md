I﻿n 2023 I have read 34 books and listened to 30 audiobooks - as well as reading many play scripts and listening to countless podcast episodes!

I﻿ give all books a mark out of ten. This is purely an enjoyment mark! Although the quality of the writing does have a big effect on how much I enjoy it, I never try to mark a book on how "good" it is. Who am I to say?!

T﻿his is a list of all the books I gave a full 10/10 to in 2023...

* *M﻿rs England* - Stacey Halls
* *A﻿ Little Life* - Hanya Yanagihara
* *I﻿ Capture the Castle* - Dodie Smith
* *A﻿n Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth* - Chris Hadfield
* *I﻿ Have Some Questions For You* - Rebecca Makkai
* *D﻿emon Copperhead* - Barbara Kingsolver
* *N﻿otes on an Execution* - Danya Kukafka
* *T﻿he Other Side of Mrs Wood* - Lucy Barker
