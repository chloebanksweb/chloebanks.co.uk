I﻿t's a wrap! My dystopian play, Human Resources, has just finished a short run of rehearsed readings with Hall for Cornwall, as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company's 37 Plays Project.

I﻿t was such a pleasure and a privilege to spend two days working with director Aga Blonska and a group of talented professional actors to create this reading. It was performed as part of an evening of readings (alongside fellow-37 Plays winner, Effort/Less by Hayley Rose, and three extracts from local playwrights) at Hall for Cornwall in Truro, The Ladder in Redruth and The Liskerritt Centre in Liskeard. 

I﻿ was bowled over by the performances of the actors and had a brilliant time seeing my characters come to life. It's definitely given me a taste for more of it! I'm hoping that a professional producer will want to put on a full production of Human Resources in the future. It was great to be able to take part in Q&A sessions after each reading and talk to the audience about the play itself and the 37 Plays project as a whole. 

I﻿'m so grateful to the RSC, Hall for Cornwall (especially Helen Tiplady), Aga Blonska and all the actors involved: Victoria Bolt, Tom Josling, Catrin Walker Booth, Josh Penrose, Charlotte Bister and Richard Hainsworth.
