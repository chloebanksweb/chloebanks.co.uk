Rachel is 10 years-old when a dog is rocketed into space. When she is 16,
the first female astronaut orbits the earth. At 17, she falls in love with
Tommy. But Rachel and Tommy’s love is not written in those distant stars. Facing
disapproval and uncertainty, they find themselves forced apart.

Half a century later, when they bump into each other in a hotel bar, Rachel and
Tommy are confronted with a lifetime of what-ifs. Rachel’s life of social
conformity has brought her the joys and heartbreaks of motherhood. Tommy’s
marriage into high society has made him the most famous artist of a generation.
But what if they had never given up on their dreams of adventure? Is what they
gained apart worth as much as all they might have had together?

_At the Bottom of the Stairs_ is a story of climbing trees and female space
explorers; of loving the life you didn’t lead and learning to love the one you
did.
