Hello! Thank you for wanting to know more about me. What to say?

Well, my first literary success came at the age of seven, with a five-page novel about a man trying to find his dog after it fell off a cliff. I followed this up a couple of years later by winning an award for a poem I wrote about my grandpa. After that it all went downhill.

After a youth spent running round athletics tracks and studying science, I came back to writing when I accepted a dare to enter an undergraduate novel-writing competition. Having made the shortlist for this award, I accidentally forgot to stop writing again.

My short and flash fiction stories have made longlists, shortlists and earned a modest handful of prizes along the way. If you’d like to read an example, my story ‘Exchange Rate’ (Ellipsis Zine, 2019) was selected as one of the pieces of Best British and Irish Flash Fiction of the year (BIFFY50), and you can read it [here](https://www.ellipsiszine.com/exchange-rate-by-chloe-banks/). My first novel, THE ART OF LETTING GO, was published by Thistle Publishing in 2014.

I am currently working on my first full-length play scripts, as well as the odd short play and piece of flash fiction. My novella, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS, will be published by Reflex Press in 2022.

When not writing, I like to walk near my home on Dartmoor – where I live with my husband and our two young sons. I love pudding, wildflowers and pretty graphs. I don’t like spiders or celery.
