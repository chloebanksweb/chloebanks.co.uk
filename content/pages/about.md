![Writer, Chloe Banks. Hello!](/uploads/chloe-14-web.jpg "chloebanks")

Hello! Do you want to know more about me?


Well, my first literary success came at the age of seven, with a five-page novel about a man trying to find his dog after it fell off a cliff. I followed this up a couple of years later by winning an award for a poem I wrote about my grandpa. After that it all went downhill.


Following a youth spent running round athletics tracks and studying science, I came back to writing when I accepted a dare to enter an undergraduate novel-writing competition. Having made the shortlist for this award, I accidentally forgot to stop writing again.


My short and flash fiction stories have made longlists, shortlists and earned a handful of prizes along the way. If you’d like to read an example, my story ‘Exchange Rate’ (Ellipsis Zine, 2019) was selected as one of the pieces of Best British and Irish Flash Fiction of the year (BIFFY50), and you can read it here. My first novel, THE ART OF LETTING GO, was published by Thistle Publishing in 2014. My novella, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS, was published by Reflex Press in 2022.


I now concentrate mainly on scriptwriting for stage and screen. My play HUMAN RESOURCES is part of the Royal Shakespeare Company’s folio of 37 new plays, and I have had some short plays produced by various community theatres. My first short film entered production in July 2023. To find out more about my script work please check out my scripts page.


When not writing, I like to walk near my home on Dartmoor – where I live with my husband and our two sons. I love pudding, wildflowers and pretty graphs. I don’t like spiders or celery.
