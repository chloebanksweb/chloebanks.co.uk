Since 2020, Chloe has been writing scripts for stage and screen. She has had her short plays produced in festivals and community theatres. She wrote and co-produced (with director, Emma Stansfield) her first short film, 'Exchange Rate', in 2023, which has been show at festivals and won awards in the UK and elsewhere.

In 2023, Chloe’s one-act play Human Resources  was one of 37 selected by the Royal Shakespeare Company to [create a new folio](https://37plays.co.uk/) of “plays for our time”, celebrating 400 years since Shakespeare’s 37 plays were first collected. The play was showcased at Hall for Cornwall in autumn 2023, directed by Aga Blonska. It had previously been staged by Putney Community Theatre in May 2022, and is available for professional production.
