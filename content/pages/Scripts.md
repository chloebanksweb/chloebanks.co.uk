In 2020, Chloe wrote her first play scripts. She started by adapting her flash
story, _Exchange Rate_ (Ellipsis Zine, 2019) into a monologue, which was
performed by the fabulous Emma Stansfield (Coronation Street, Jamie Johnson).

Chloe’s first ten-minute play, _Dating With Dostoyevsky_, was one of the six
winners of the Pint-Sized Plays competition. Then another, _Screen Test_, was
selected by Antony Eden (The Woman in Black, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child)
to produce, starring Julia Hills (Who Dares Wins, 2Point4 Children, The Archers)
for Muck and Rumble, in aid of the Roald Dahl’s Marvellous Children’s Charity.

Her first one-act play, _Human Resources_, was performed by Putney Community Theatre in May 2022. Her 10-minute play, _Desk Monster_, was performed as part of the KDC Theatre festival of new writing in June 2022.

Since then Chloe has been working on her first full-length stage plays and short screen scripts, and trying to read and learn all she can about the art of writing them!
