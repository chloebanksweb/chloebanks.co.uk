Since 2020, Chloe has been writing scripts for stage and screen. Her first project was to adapt her flash story, Exchange Rate (Ellipsis Zine, 2019) into a monologue, which was performed by Emma Stansfield (Coronation Street, Jamie Johnson). Emma and Chloe have since adapted it into a short film that entered production in July 2023.

In 2023, Chloe’s one-act play Human Resources  was one of 37 selected by the Royal Shakespeare Company to [create a new folio](https://37plays.co.uk/) of “plays for our time”, celebrating 400 years since Shakespeare’s 37 plays were first collected. The play will be showcased at Hall for Cornwall in autumn 2023. It has previously been staged by Putney Community Theatre in May 2022, and is available for professional production.

Other scripts:

* Dating with Dostoyevsky – ten minute play; one of the six winners of the Pint-Sized Plays competition, 2020. 
* Screen Test – short play produced by Antony Eden (The Woman in Black, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child), starring Julia Hills (Who Dares Wins, 2Point4 Children, The Archers) for Muck and Rumble, in aid of the Roald Dahl’s Marvellous Children’s Charity, 2021. You can view Julia’s wonderful performance of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX059EwW5Qg). 
* Desk Monster – 10-minute play, performed as part of KDC Theatre’s festival of new writing, June 2022.
* Drystone – short film script, winner of the Action on the Side script competition, 2023; currently a finalist in the White Rose International Film Festival (November 2023).

Chloe is currently working on a variety of projects, including full-length stage scripts and more short film scripts. She has been selected to take part in the London Playwrights writer development scheme, starting September 2023.
