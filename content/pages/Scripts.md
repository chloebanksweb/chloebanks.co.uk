In 2020, Chloe wrote her first play scripts. She started by adapting her flash
story, *Exchange Rate* (Ellipsis Zine, 2019) into a monologue, which was
performed by the fabulous Emma Stansfield (Coronation Street, Jamie Johnson).

Chloe’s first ten-minute play, *Dating With Dostoyevsky*, was one of the six
winners of the Pint-Sized Plays competition. Then another, *Screen Test*, was
selected by Antony Eden (The Woman in Black, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child)
to produce, starring Julia Hills (Who Dares Wins, 2Point4 Children, The Archers)
for Muck and Rumble, in aid of the Roald Dahl’s Marvellous Children’s Charity.

Since then Chloe has been working on her first full-length stage plays and trying to
read and learn all she can about the art of writing them!
